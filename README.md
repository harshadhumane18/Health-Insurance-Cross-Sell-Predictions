## Project Overview
The Health Insurance Cross Sell Predictions project aims to build a predictive model for an insurance company. The model will predict whether existing health insurance policyholders would be interested in the companyâ€™s vehicle insurance. This prediction is based on various customer details like demographics, vehicle information, and policy details.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to help the insurance company optimize its business model and revenue. By predicting customer interest in vehicle insurance, the company can plan its communication strategy effectively. This targeted approach can lead to higher cross-sell rates, enhancing the companyâ€™s growth and profitability.

## Machine Learning Project Approach
The general approach for this machine learning project will be as follows:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources and combine them into a single, coherent dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution and correlation of variables, identify patterns and trends in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.
5. **Model Building**: Build a classification model to predict whether a customer would be interested in vehicle insurance.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction project successfully identified key insights from the dataset. The analysis revealed an imbalanced dataset, with a majority of individuals showing little interest in health insurance cross-sell. Gender analysis indicated a slightly higher interest among males. Age-wise, middle-aged individuals exhibited the highest interest, while younger and older populations showed lower interest levels. Driving license holders were the primary target for cross-selling, but the response varied, suggesting a nuanced relationship between license possession and interest. Previous insurance history also played a role, with those without prior insurance showing higher interest. Vehicle age and damage were influential factors, with older vehicles and damaged ones associated with increased interest. The rejection of null hypotheses reinforced the significance of age and vehicle damage in predicting health insurance interest. These findings provide valuable insights for targeted marketing and product customization in the health insurance cross-sell domain.
